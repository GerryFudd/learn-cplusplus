# This is a library that I am using to learn c++

## The parts of this project

This project is a hodgepodge of code that I wrote as an exercise to focus my learning, notes on implementation, and examples of patterns that I can follow in the future.

## The code sample

The BigInt class is my first code challenge. It is intended to be a c++ implementation of the BigInteger class in java.math. The file ./other/notes.txt is a collection of code snippets from that java implementation. The code sample will be complete when I have implemented all of the public methods from this file using the underlying algorithms.

## The notes about c++

The [Personal guide to c++](./PERSONAL_GUIDE.md) file contains the most important details about the language that I want to document for my future self.

## Open questions

The [Open questions](./OPEN_QESTIONS.md) file contains the most critical knowledge about c++ that I currently don't understand.
